# Compatibility requirements file
# ===============================
#
# This module includes optional dependencies which could be required (or not)
# based on your python version.
#
# They should be forward-compatible so you can install them all if you are not
# sure.
#
# This requirements are conditional dependencies on 'source' distributable
# packages, but regular dependencies of 'binary' distributable packages
# (see `setup.py`).
